    "This heavyweight species of monster can be found all over Hyrule. They're physically very strong, their legs along strong enough to resist the force of a bomb blast. They're much more dangerous than the Bokoblins. In fact, Moblins have been known to pick up Bokoblins and throw them as makeshift projectile weapons.",
